# Home Credit Default Risk Analysis
**Capstone Group Project Summer 2023**

## Business Problem and Project Objective   
A significant portion of the population, particularly those with insufficient or non-existent credit histories, are more vulnerable to untrustworthy lenders who may take advantage of them. Home Credit looks to address this problem by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience for the unbanked population.
The goal for this project will be the reduction in loan rejections for creditworthy individuals, and the improvement in clients' loan repayment rates compared to previous methods by using the target variable of whether a client is likely to repay the loan or not. This project is aiming to identify a predictive analytical model that will identify the customers who are likely to default or not.

## Our group solution
For our solution on this analytics project, we will use the existing dataset and associated data description to identify the appropriate predictors and come up with the best predictive analytical model. This notebook serves the purpose of identifying the best model after exploring different classification models to that can solve the Business problem of HomeCredit.

## Contribution 
My involvement in the project encompassed conducting thorough exploratory data analysis, leveraging the provided datasets, and data descriptions to gain comprehensive insights. Additionally, I applied feature engineering techniques to assess their impact on the model's performance during testing. Through the implementation of diverse visualization charts, we gained valuable perspectives from our data, aiding us in the modeling phase. To estimate the potential accuracy improvement, I also developed a simple model. My work played a crucial role in understanding the data intricacies and laying the groundwork for informed decision-making throughout the project. Although not all of my code made it into the final project, as other team members proposed alternative approaches, you can find some of my contributions to the analysis in this link: [provide link here]. 

## Business Value
After implementing the intervention for predicted defaulters using Random Forest and then LGB, the test accuracy of the best-performing model increased from 0.71 to 0.72. This resulted in a 1.41% increase in good loans, indicating a potential improvement in successful loan repayments. The dollar value of this percentage increase, based on a hypothetical total loan value of $12,000,000 and an average loan amount of $25,000 for good loans, would be approximately $169,200. The intervention appears to have positively impacted the model's performance, potentially leading to higher revenue from successful loan repayments. However, further analysis and fine-tuning may still be required to optimize the model and ensure the business value of the intervention.

## Challenges along the way
During our analysis, we encountered several challenges. Dealing with imbalanced data, where the number of defaulters was significantly lower than non-defaulters, required us to implement techniques like oversampling and undersampling. Data preprocessing and feature engineering were complex tasks, and selecting optimal hyperparameters for the models demanded extensive experimentation. We also had to be cautious of potential biases in the data to ensure fairness and transparency. Collaboration and communication within the team were vital for tackling these challenges effectively. Despite the difficulties, the experience provided valuable insights into predictive modeling and ethical considerations for real-world business problems.

## Lessons learned
We gained valuable lessons that enriched our data science journey. Firstly, dealing with imbalanced data taught us the importance of addressing this issue early on, as it significantly impacts model performance. Techniques like oversampling and undersampling proved effective in handling such situations. Secondly, we realized the significance of thorough data preprocessing and feature engineering, as they directly influence the model's accuracy and interpretability. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation were crucial steps to optimize performance and avoid overfitting. Moreover, we learned about the ethical implications of predictive modeling, understanding the responsibility of ensuring fairness and transparency to avoid potential biases. Team collaboration and effective communication were essential in navigating through challenges and arriving at robust solutions. This analysis provided valuable experience in real-world problem-solving, reinforcing the importance of continuous learning and adaptability in the ever-evolving field of data science.
